The preprocess module
==================================

The preprocess module is the first module in the pipeline, taking care of the basic text preprocessing tasks of tokenization (Ucto / Frog), stemming and part-of-speech tagging (Frog). 

Inputfile
--------

The preprocess module takes text documents as input. They can come in two formats:

- File with text documents on each line. Note that text documents with a linebreak will be seen as two separate documents
  Extension: .txt
- Directory with text documents (files ending with '.txt')
  Extension: .txtdir
